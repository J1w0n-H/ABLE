************** configuration **************
You are an expert skilled in C/C++ environment configuration. You can refer to various files and structures in the repository such as `Makefile`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `configure.ac`, etc., and install the corresponding system libraries and build dependencies in a given Docker image. This ensures that the repository can be successfully configured and able to correctly compile and execute the specified tests.
* Note that this repository originally did not have a Dockerfile, or the existing Dockerfile has been deleted, and do not attempt to use the information from the original Dockerfile of the repository.*

* This is a C/C++ project environment. We have basic build tools available (gcc, g++, make, cmake). You need to ensure all necessary dependencies are installed.*

WORK PROCESS:
1. **Read Directory Structure**: Check the folder structure in the root directory, focusing on build configuration files (Makefile, CMakeLists.txt, configure, etc.).
2. **Check the configuration files in the root directory**: Read build configuration files such as: `Makefile`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `configure.ac`, `configure.sh`, `.github` folder for CI configurations, `README.md` for build instructions, etc.
    **IMPORTANT - Smart File Reading to Avoid Token Overflow**:
    - ⚠️ NEVER use `cat` on large files (>100 lines) - this wastes tokens!
    - ✅ Use `head -50 <file>` or `head -100 <file>` to read first N lines
    - ✅ Use `tail -50 <file>` to read last N lines
    - ✅ Use `grep -n <keyword> <file>` to search for specific content (e.g., `grep -n "find_package\|PKG_CHECK" CMakeLists.txt`)
    - ✅ Use `wc -l <file>` first to check file size before reading
    - ✅ For very large files (>500 lines), use multiple targeted commands instead of reading everything
    - Example: Instead of `cat Makefile`, use `head -50 Makefile` to see build targets and `grep "LIBS\|LDFLAGS" Makefile` for dependencies
2.5 **Try testing (optional)**: Using `runtest` command to check if it is possible to pass the tests directly without any additional configuration.
3. **Review Additional Files**: Consider other potential files and structures for environment configuration, such as dependency files, installation scripts, or documentation.
4. **Analyze build dependencies**: Based on the observed structure in the root directory, determine the necessary system packages and libraries:
    a. CMake Detected: If CMakeLists.txt exists, check for find_package() or pkg_check_modules() calls to identify required libraries.
    b. Makefile Detected: If Makefile exists, check for library dependencies (usually specified with -l flags).
    c. Configure Script: If configure or configure.ac exists, examine for AC_CHECK_LIB or PKG_CHECK_MODULES to find dependencies.
    d. README/INSTALL: Check documentation for explicit dependency lists.
5. **Install system dependencies**: Use apt-get to install required libraries and development packages:
    - For each library dependency, install the corresponding -dev package (e.g., libssl-dev, libcurl4-openssl-dev)
    - Install build tools if needed (autoconf, automake, libtool, pkg-config, etc.)
    - Use `apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y -qq <packages>` for quiet installation
6. **Run build configuration**: If the project uses autoconf/configure:
    - Run `./autogen.sh` or `autoreconf -i` if needed
    - Run `./configure` with appropriate flags
    - Check for any missing dependencies reported by configure
7. **Build the project**: Try to compile the project:
    - For Makefile projects: run `make` or `make all`
    - For CMake projects: run `mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make`
    - Fix any compilation errors by installing missing dependencies
8. **Error Handling**: After attempting to build or test, handle error messages:
    - Missing header files: Install corresponding -dev packages (e.g., fatal error: openssl/ssl.h → install libssl-dev)
    - Missing libraries: Install library packages (e.g., cannot find -lz → install zlib1g-dev)
    - Missing tools: Install build tools (e.g., aclocal not found → install automake)
    You can make use of the following tools:
    a. `apt-cache search <keyword>`: Search for available packages
    b. `apt-cache show <package>`: Show package information
    c. `dpkg -L <package>`: List files installed by a package
    d. `pkg-config --list-all`: List all packages known to pkg-config
    e. `pkg-config --cflags --libs <package>`: Show compile and link flags for a package
    f. `apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y -qq <package>`: Install system packages quietly
    g. `export <variable>=<value>`: Set environment variables (CC, CXX, CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, etc.)
    h. `ldconfig`: Update shared library cache if needed
    i. You can use the `--help` or `man` command to view detailed usage instructions for various tools
    j. You may also use other commands that are not listed here, including built-in Bash commands and other system commands.
    *Note*: Always consider the potential impact of each command on the system. Aim to achieve the best results with minimal changes.
    *Note*: For missing headers or libraries, first check if they are part of the project itself (local includes) before installing external packages.
    *Note*: Do not use external download tools like `git clone` or `wget` to download a large number of files directly in the /repo folder (or its subdirectories) to avoid causing significant changes to the original repository.
    *Note*: Flexibility: You do not need to complete all configurations in one go. You can use the `runtest` command at any time. I will check the configured environment and return any error messages. Based on the error messages, you can make further adjustments.
    *Note*: In special cases, if you feel that the Docker environment has become too messy to achieve your goal, you can use `clear_configuration` command to restore it to the initial clean environment and start over.
**Most Important!** You can execute `runtest` anywhere when you decide to test the environment. You do not need to complete all the previous steps; you can directly run `runtest` to check if the configuration is complete and get feedback from the error messages. Be flexible. Our goal is to pass the runtest checks.
If you encounter compilation errors or missing dependencies, you can consider two solutions. One solution is to use apt-get to install system packages and development libraries. The other solution is to check for local dependencies in the repository; if local dependencies are available, you can set appropriate environment variables (PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, etc.) to resolve the issue.
Please note that when using apt-get or other tools to install packages, try to use the `-qq` (quiet) mode if available to reduce intermediate progress outputs. Additionally, we will help remove more obvious progress bar information to minimize interference with the analysis.
If you need to install system packages using apt-get, please consider adding them to the waiting list first, and then use the `download` command to proceed with the installation.
In each round of the conversation, we will inform you of the commands that have been correctly executed and have changed the state of the current Docker container. Please reflect on each round's Observation in relation to the current state of the Docker container and decide the subsequent Action.
If you need to run two or more commands, please strictly follow the order by enclosing each command in ONE ```bash and ``` blocks connected by "&&" with ONE line! It is not recommended to use backslashes (\) for line continuation. If you need to execute commands that span multiple lines, it is advisable to write them into a .sh file and then run the executable file. For example, if you want to enter the /repo directory and execute `make`, you should input:
```bash
cd /repo && make
```

It is not recommended to directly input:
```bash
cd /repo
```
```bash
make
```

Nor is it recommended to input:
```bash
cd /repo \
make
```

We also strongly request that you try to write the instructions on the same line as much as possible, and do not break them into multiple lines, as this may cause parsing errors. Even if the line of instructions contains a lot of && connections, do not arbitrarily break it into multiple lines.

We will automatically maintain two lists in the background to facilitate the installation and download of system packages and libraries. These are:
1. waiting list: Used to store system packages waiting to be installed via apt-get. You can use `waitinglist show` to show all items in it.
2. conflict list: Used to store elements with the same name as those in the waiting list but with inconsistent constraints. You can use `conflictlist show` to show all items in it.
*Note*: you only need to follow the prompts to complete operations on these lists during the running process and can only manipulate them using the provided commands.
*Note*: Before operating waiting list, conflict list, or download commands, you can use waitinglist show or conflictlist show to observe their structure each time.


IN GOOD FORMAT: 
All your answer must contain Thought and Action. 
Calling CLI tools Action using bash block like ```bash  ```. 
Editing and Writing code Action using diff block like ```diff ```.
The command line you generate will be run in the bash sandbox environment, and the running results will be returned to you through the system messages.

IMPORTANT TIPS: 
        * Each round of reply can only contain one ```bash ``` block, which means Each round of your answers contain only *ONE* action!
        * Please submit the first command first, then after receiving the response, you can issue the second command. You are free to use any other bash communication.

You are now in the Docker environment of gcr.io/oss-fuzz-base/base-builder. Please perform all operations within this environment.
CLI TOOLS: You can call CLI tools in  ```bash ... ``` block as Action with a Thought. like:
### Thought: I need to understand the structure of the root directory.
### Action:
```bash
ls /repo
```

For another example:
### Thought: I need to read the README.md file.
### Action:
```bash
cat README.md
```


CODE EDITING AND WRITING: All changes to files must use the ```diff  ```  block format, with symbols <<<<<<< SEARCH, ======= and >>>>>>> REPLACE 

You need to provide code patch. The patch should according to the original code, indent correctly, and do not include line numbers. The format is as follows: 
### Thought: Modify explanation...
### Action: 
```diff 
/absolute/path/of/target.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    exact copy of old line(s) you would like to change
=======
    new line(s) to replace
>>>>>>> REPLACE

<<<<<<< SEARCH
    exact copy of old line(s) you would like to change
=======
    new line(s) to replace
>>>>>>> REPLACE
``` 
Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block must use this format:
1. The opening fence ```diff 
2. The file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
5. The dividing line: =======
6. The lines to replace into the source code
7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
8. The closing fence: ``` 
Once you want to modify the code you MUST: 
        * Include *ALL* the code being searched and replaced!
        * Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing source code, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
        * '<<<<<<< SEARCH', '=======' and  '>>>>>>> REPLACE' symbols must be on a line by themselves and cannot be indented.
        * All code modifications must be expressed in the REPLACE format above (including delete an insert). We will find the source code with the highest matching degree in the original file and replace it. Please provide sufficient and unique old line(s) from snippet to facilitate matching.
        * If the code patch you provide is successfully applied, the differences before and after the code modification will be returned.
        * The paths of modified files must be completely absolute paths.
        * Make sure the patch you provide is indented correctly especially in python programs: The indentation of old lines is exactly the same as the original code, and the indentation of new lines is correct.
        * All patches must be based on the original code viewed by the tools, and fabricated code patch(es) is prohibited.
        * Previously successfully applied patches will modify the code, and new patches must be applied based on the current code. Please review the relevant code again then provide new patches.
        * If the old line(s) is empty, it is considered to be inserted at the beginning of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created and the new line will be written. like:
### Thought: Create a.py
### Action:
```diff
/project_path/.../a.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
    [new line(s) to add]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

*Note*: Do not make extensive changes to the existing files in the /repo folder. You may only make appropriate and necessary changes to the original repository files (e.g., when there are actual errors or tests that cannot be run).
*Very Important Note*: Passing tests by modifying testing functions is not allowed, and you should figure out how to make the current test functions run successfully!!!
In addition to typical bash commands, we also provide the following commands that can be used, you can use them flexibly if needed:
waitinglist add -p package_name -t apt [-v version_constraints] # Add item into waiting list using apt-get. The -t apt flag is REQUIRED. Version constraints are optional (defaults to latest).
waitinglist addfile file_path # Add all entries from a file similar to requirements.txt format to the waiting list.
waitinglist clear # Used to clear all the items in the waiting list.
conflictlist solve -u # Keep the original version constraint that exists in the waiting list, and discard the other version constraints with the same name and tool in the conflict list.
conflictlist clear # Used to clear all the items in the conflict list.
conflictlist show # Used to show all the items in the conflict list.
waitinglist show # Used to show all the items in the waiting list.
download # Download all pending elements in the waiting list at once.
runtest # Check if the configured environment is correct.
clear_configuration # Reset all the configuration to the initial clean C build environment.


VERY IMPORTANT TIPS: 
    * You should not answer the user's question, your task is to configure the C/C++ build environment within the given setup. You need to follow the steps mentioned above and flexibly use various commands. After entering test, ensure that the environment passes the test.

I need to understand the structure of the root directory to identify the build configuration files and other relevant files.

### Action:
```bash
ls /repo
```

---------------------------
### Thought:
The root directory contains several important files and directories, including `configure`, `configure.ac`, `Makefile.am`, and `Makefile.in`. These files suggest that the project uses the Autotools build system. I will start by examining the `configure.ac` file to identify the necessary dependencies and configuration options.

### Action:
```bash
head -50 /repo/configure.ac
```

### Thought:
The `configure.ac` file contains macros and definitions for the Autotools build system. To identify the required dependencies, I need to look for `AC_CHECK_LIB`, `PKG_CHECK_MODULES`, and other similar macros. I will search for these keywords in the `configure.ac` file.

### Action:
```bash
grep -n "AC_CHECK_LIB\|PKG_CHECK_MODULES" /repo/configure.ac
```

---------------------------
### Thought:
The `configure.ac` file checks for several libraries using `AC_CHECK_LIB` and `PKG_CHECK_MODULES`. Some of the libraries and modules it checks for include:
- `m` (math library)
- `openmp`, `omp`, `gomp`, `mtsk`, `xlsmp`, `mp` (OpenMP-related libraries)
- `jemalloc`, `tcmalloc_minimal` (memory allocators)
- `tiff` (TIFF image format)
- `libwebp`, `libwebpmux`, `libwebpdemux` (WebP image format)
- `libxml-2.0` (XML parsing)

I will add these libraries to the waiting list for installation.

### Action:
```bash
waitinglist add -p libtiff-dev -t apt && waitinglist add -p libwebp-dev -t apt && waitinglist add -p libxml2-dev -t apt && waitinglist add -p libjemalloc-dev -t apt && waitinglist add -p libtcmalloc-minimal4 -t apt && waitinglist add -p libomp-dev -t apt && waitinglist add -p libgomp1 -t apt && waitinglist add -p libm-dev -t apt
```
### Observation:

You are currently in a [gcr.io/oss-fuzz-base/base-builder] container.

ENVIRONMENT REMINDER: You have 96 turns left to complete the task.
The container remains in its original state.
---------------------------
### Thought:
I have added the necessary libraries to the waiting list. Now, I need to download and install these packages using `apt-get`.

### Action:
```bash
download
```
### Observation:
Running `download`...
'libtiff-dev' has been removed from the waiting list.
"libtiff-dev" installed successfully.
'libwebp-dev' has been removed from the waiting list.
"libwebp-dev" installed successfully.
'libxml2-dev' has been removed from the waiting list.
"libxml2-dev" installed successfully.
'libjemalloc-dev' has been removed from the waiting list.

You are currently in a [gcr.io/oss-fuzz-base/base-builder] container.

ENVIRONMENT REMINDER: You have 95 turns left to complete the task.
The container has successfully executed the following commands in order. Please refer to the execution history, reflect, and decide the subsequent actions. Remember, your ultimate goal is to pass the tests by executing `runtest`.
apt-get install libtiff-dev

---------------------------
### Thought:
The installation of `libm-dev` failed because the package could not be located. The math library is typically included in the standard C library (glibc), so it might not require a separate installation. I will proceed to configure the project using the `configure` script to identify any remaining missing dependencies.

### Action:
```bash
cd /repo && ./configure
```
### Observation:
