Your goal is to build a C project successfully.\n\nWORK PROCESS:\n1. **Check Project Structure**: Look for Makefile, CMakeLists.txt, or main.c files\n2. **Identify Build System**: Determine the appropriate build method\n   - Makefile exists \u2192 use `run_make`\n   - CMakeLists.txt exists \u2192 use `run_cmake` \n   - Only .c files \u2192 use `run_gcc`\n3. **Install Dependencies**: If needed, use `apt_install package_name` for system libraries\n4. **Build Project**: Execute the appropriate build command\n5. **Verify Success**: Ensure the build completes without errors\n\nAVAILABLE TOOLS:\n- `run_make`: Build using make command\n- `run_cmake`: Build using cmake (configure + make)\n- `run_gcc`: Direct gcc compilation\n- `apt_install package_name`: Install system packages\n\nGOAL: Build the C project successfully. When build succeeds, output:\n\"Congratulations, you have successfully built the C project!\"\n\nYou are now in a C build environment. Please perform all operations within this environment.\n"
