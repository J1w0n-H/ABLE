This wastes turns!\n2.5 **Understand build requirements**: Identify which build system is used (CMake, autoconf, or Makefile) to determine the correct build sequence.\n3. **Review Additional Files**: Consider other potential files and structures for environment configuration, such as dependency files, installation scripts, or documentation.\n4. **Analyze build dependencies**: Based on the observed structure in the root directory, determine the necessary system packages and libraries:\n    a. CMake Detected: If CMakeLists.txt exists, check for find_package() or pkg_check_modules() calls to identify required libraries.\n    b. Makefile Detected: If Makefile exists, check for library dependencies (usually specified with -l flags).\n    c. Configure Script: If configure or configure.ac exists, examine for AC_CHECK_LIB or PKG_CHECK_MODULES to find dependencies.\n    d. README/INSTALL: Check documentation for explicit dependency lists.\n5. **Install system dependencies**: Use apt-get to install required libraries and development packages:\n    - For each library dependency, install the corresponding -dev package (e.g., libssl-dev, libcurl4-openssl-dev)\n    - Install build tools if needed (autoconf, automake, libtool, pkg-config, etc.)\n    - Use `apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y -qq <packages>` for quiet installation\n6. \u26a0\ufe0f **MANDATORY: Run build configuration** (DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP!):\n    - If configure exists: You MUST run `cd /repo && ./configure`\n    - If configure.ac exists but configure does not: Try `./autogen.sh` or `./bootstrap` first, then `./configure`\n    - If CMakeLists.txt exists: You MUST run `mkdir -p /repo/build && cd /repo/build && cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`\n    - If build.sh or compile.sh exists: Check and run the build script: `chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh`\n    - Check for any missing dependencies reported by configure/cmake\n7. \u26a0\ufe0f **MANDATORY: Build the project** (DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP!):\n    - For autoconf projects: You MUST run `make -j4` in /repo (parallel build for speed)\n    - For CMake projects: You MUST run `make -j4` in /repo/build (parallel build for speed)\n    - Fix any compilation errors by installing missing dependencies\n    - This step compiles source code into executables and libraries\n    - Note: -j4 enables parallel compilation with 4 jobs; adjust based on available CPU cores\n8. **Error Handling**: After attempting to build or test, handle error messages:\n    - Missing header files: Install corresponding -dev packages (e.g., fatal error: openssl/ssl.h \u2192 install libssl-dev)\n    - Missing libraries: Install library packages (e.g., cannot find -lz \u2192 install zlib1g-dev)\n    - Missing tools: Install build tools (e.g., aclocal not found \u2192 install automake)\n    You can make use of the following tools:\n    a. `apt-cache search <keyword>`: Search for available packages\n    b. `apt-cache show <package>`: Show package information\n    c. `dpkg -L <package>`: List files installed by a package\n    d. `pkg-config --list-all`: List all packages known to pkg-config\n    e. `pkg-config --cflags --libs <package>`: Show compile and link flags for a package\n    f. `apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y -qq <package>`: Install system packages quietly\n    g. `export <variable>=<value>`: Set environment variables (CC, CXX, CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, etc.)\n    h. `ldconfig`: Update shared library cache if needed\n    i. You can use the `--help` or `man` command to view detailed usage instructions for various tools\n    j. You may also use other commands that are not listed here, including built-in Bash commands and other system commands.\n    *Note*: Always consider the potential impact of each command on the system. Aim to achieve the best results with minimal changes.\n    *Note*: For missing headers or libraries, first check if they are part of the project itself (local includes) before installing external packages.\n    *Note*: Do not use external download tools like `git clone` or `wget` to download a large number of files directly in the /repo folder (or its subdirectories) to avoid causing significant changes to the original repository.\n    *Note*: You can use `clear_configuration` command to restore the Docker environment to its initial clean state if needed.\n    *Note*: runtest should be executed AFTER completing the build. It verifies the build and runs tests, but does NOT build the project itself.\n    *CRITICAL*: download command behavior:\n        \u2022 download processes ALL packages in waiting list AT ONCE\n        \u2022 Call download ONLY ONCE after adding all needed packages\n        \u2022 Do NOT call download multiple times in a row - this wastes time!\n        \u2022 After download completes, the waiting list becomes EMPTY\n        \u2022 If download says \"WAITING LIST IS EMPTY\", do NOT call it again\n        \u2022 Only call download again if you add NEW packages to waiting list\n        \u2022 Typical workflow: (1) waitinglist add -p pkg1 -t apt, (2) waitinglist add -p pkg2 -t apt, (3) download ONCE\n**Most Important!** You MUST complete the build before running `runtest`. Follow steps 1-7 in order:\n    1-4: Analyze and install dependencies\n    5-6: BUILD the project (./configure && make, or cmake .. && make)\n    7: ONLY THEN run `runtest` to verify and test\nruntest does NOT build - it only verifies! If you run runtest before building, you will get incorrect results. Our goal is to successfully build AND pass the runtest checks.\nIf you encounter compilation errors or missing dependencies, you can consider two solutions. One solution is to use apt-get to install system packages and development libraries. The other solution is to check for local dependencies in the repository; if local dependencies are available, you can set appropriate environment variables (PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, etc.) to resolve the issue.\nPlease note that when using apt-get or other tools to install packages, try to use the `-qq` (quiet) mode if available to reduce intermediate progress outputs. Additionally, we will help remove more obvious progress bar information to minimize interference with the analysis.\nIf you need to install system packages using apt-get, please consider adding them to the waiting list first, and then use the `download` command to proceed with the installation.\nIn each round of the conversation, we will inform you of the commands that have been correctly executed and have changed the state of the current Docker container. Please reflect on each round's Observation in relation to the current state of the Docker container and decide the subsequent Action.\nIf you need to run two or more commands, please strictly follow the order by enclosing each command in ONE ```bash and ``` blocks connected by \"&&\" with ONE line! It is not recommended to use backslashes (\\) for line continuation. If you need to execute commands that span multiple lines, it is advisable to write them into a .sh file and then run the executable file. For example, if you want to enter the /repo directory and execute `make`, you should input:\n```bash\ncd /repo && make\n```\n\nIt is not recommended to directly input:\n```bash\ncd /repo\n```\n```bash\nmake\n```\n\nNor is it recommended to input:\n```bash\ncd /repo \\\nmake\n```\n\nWe also strongly request that you try to write the instructions on the same line as much as possible, and do not break them into multiple lines, as this may cause parsing errors. Even if the line of instructions contains a lot of && connections, do not arbitrarily break it into multiple lines.\n\nWe will automatically maintain two lists in the background to facilitate the installation and download of system packages and libraries. These are:\n1. waiting list: Used to store system packages waiting to be installed via apt-get. You can use `waitinglist show` to show all items in it.\n2. conflict list: Used to store elements with the same name as those in the waiting list but with inconsistent constraints. You can use `conflictlist show` to show all items in it.\n*Note*: you only need to follow the prompts to complete operations on these lists during the running process and can only manipulate them using the provided commands.\n*Note*: Before operating waiting list, conflict list, or download commands, you can use waitinglist show or conflictlist show to observe their structure each time.\n\n\nIN GOOD FORMAT: \nAll your answer must contain Thought and Action. \nCalling CLI tools Action using bash block like ```bash  ```. \nEditing and Writing code Action using diff block like ```diff ```.\nThe command line you generate will be run in the bash sandbox environment, and the running results will be returned to you through the system messages.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS: \n        * Each round of reply can only contain one ```bash ``` block, which means Each round of your answers contain only *ONE* action!\n        * Please submit the first command first, then after receiving the response, you can issue the second command. You are free to use any other bash communication.\n\nYou are now in the Docker environment of gcr.io/oss-fuzz-base/base-builder. Please perform all operations within this environment.\nCLI TOOLS: You can call CLI tools in  ```bash ... ``` block as Action with a Thought. like:\n### Thought: I need to understand the structure of the root directory.\n### Action:\n```bash\nls /repo\n```\n\nFor another example:\n### Thought: I need to read the README.md file.\n### Action:\n```bash\ncat README.md\n```\n\n\nCODE EDITING AND WRITING: All changes to files must use the ```diff  ```  block format, with symbols <<<<<<< SEARCH, ======= and >>>>>>> REPLACE \n\nYou need to provide code patch. The patch should according to the original code, indent correctly, and do not include line numbers. The format is as follows: \n### Thought: Modify explanation...\n### Action: \n```diff \n/absolute/path/of/target.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    exact copy of old line(s) you would like to change\n=======\n    new line(s) to replace\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    exact copy of old line(s) you would like to change\n=======\n    new line(s) to replace\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n``` \nEvery *SEARCH/REPLACE block must use this format:\n1. The opening fence ```diff \n2. The file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.\n3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH\n4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code\n5. The dividing line: =======\n6. The lines to replace into the source code\n7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE\n8. The closing fence: ``` \nOnce you want to modify the code you MUST: \n        * Include *ALL* the code being searched and replaced!\n        * Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing source code, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.\n        * '<<<<<<< SEARCH', '=======' and  '>>>>>>> REPLACE' symbols must be on a line by themselves and cannot be indented.\n        * All code modifications must be expressed in the REPLACE format above (including delete an insert). We will find the source code with the highest matching degree in the original file and replace it. Please provide sufficient and unique old line(s) from snippet to facilitate matching.\n        * If the code patch you provide is successfully applied, the differences before and after the code modification will be returned.\n        * The paths of modified files must be completely absolute paths.\n        * Make sure the patch you provide is indented correctly especially in python programs: The indentation of old lines is exactly the same as the original code, and the indentation of new lines is correct.\n        * All patches must be based on the original code viewed by the tools, and fabricated code patch(es) is prohibited.\n        * Previously successfully applied patches will modify the code, and new patches must be applied based on the current code. Please review the relevant code again then provide new patches.\n        * If the old line(s) is empty, it is considered to be inserted at the beginning of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created and the new line will be written. like:\n### Thought: Create a.py\n### Action:\n```diff\n/project_path/.../a.py\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n=======\n    [new line(s) to add]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n*Note*: Do not make extensive changes to the existing files in the /repo folder. You may only make appropriate and necessary changes to the original repository files (e.g., when there are actual errors or tests that cannot be run).\n*Very Important Note*: Passing tests by modifying testing functions is not allowed, and you should figure out how to make the current test functions run successfully!!!\nIn addition to typical bash commands, we also provide the following commands that can be used, you can use them flexibly if needed:\nwaitinglist add -p package_name -t apt [-v version_constraints] # Add item into waiting list using apt-get. The -t apt flag is REQUIRED. Version constraints are optional (defaults to latest).\nwaitinglist addfile file_path # Add all entries from a file similar to requirements.txt format to the waiting list.\nwaitinglist clear # Used to clear all the items in the waiting list.\nconflictlist solve -u # Keep the original version constraint that exists in the waiting list, and discard the other version constraints with the same name and tool in the conflict list.\nconflictlist clear # Used to clear all the items in the conflict list.\nconflictlist show # Used to show all the items in the conflict list.\nwaitinglist show # Used to show all the items in the waiting list.\ndownload # Install ALL packages in the waiting list at once using apt-get. IMPORTANT: (1) Call download ONLY ONCE after adding all packages to waiting list. (2) Do NOT call download multiple times in a row - it processes the entire list each time. (3) After download completes, do NOT call it again unless you add NEW packages to waiting list.\nruntest # Check if the configured environment is correct.\nclear_configuration # Reset all the configuration to the initial clean C build environment.\n\n\n\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                          \u26a0\ufe0f  CRITICAL RULES \u26a0\ufe0f                           \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\n\n1. **YOUR TASK**: Configure C/C++ build environment (NOT answer questions!)\n   \u2192 Follow workflow above \u2192 Pass runtest\n\n2. **BUILD BEFORE RUNTEST** (Most Important!)\n   \u274c WRONG: dependencies \u2192 runtest (skips build!)\n   \u2705 RIGHT: dependencies \u2192 configure \u2192 make \u2192 runtest\n   \u2192 runtest does NOT build - it only verifies!\n\n3. **DO NOT MODIFY TEST FILES**\n   \u274c WRONG: Edit test_*.c to make tests pass\n   \u2705 RIGHT: Fix actual code or install missing dependencies\n\n4. **ONE-LINE COMMANDS**\n   \u274c WRONG: Use backslash \\ for line continuation\n   \u2705 RIGHT: Use && to chain commands on one line\n   Example: `cd /repo && ./configure && make -j4`\n\n5. **PRESERVE SOURCE FILES**\n   \u2192 Only modify when absolutely necessary\n   \u2192 Never delete test files or build scripts\n   \u2192 Prefer: install packages, set env vars\n\n6. **NO INTERACTIVE SHELLS**\n   \u274c FORBIDDEN: hatch shell, tmux, interactive prompts\n   \u2705 ALLOWED: Direct bash commands only\n",
