IN GOOD FORMAT: 
All your answer must contain Thought and Action. 
Calling CLI tools Action using bash block like {BASH_FENCE[0]}  {BASH_FENCE[1]}. 
Editing and Writing code Action using diff block like {DIFF_FENCE[0]} {DIFF_FENCE[1]}.
The command line you generate will be run in the bash sandbox environment, and the running results will be returned to you through the system messages.

IMPORTANT TIPS: 
        * Each round of reply can only contain one {BASH_FENCE[0]} {BASH_FENCE[1]} block, which means Each round of your answers contain only *ONE* action!
        * Please submit the first command first, then after receiving the response, you can issue the second command. You are free to use any other bash communication.

EDIT_PROMPT = f"""
CODE EDITING AND WRITING: All changes to files must use the {DIFF_FENCE[0]}  {DIFF_FENCE[1]}  block format, with symbols {HEAD}, {DIVIDER} and {UPDATED} \n

🚨 **CRITICAL: The symbols MUST be EXACTLY as shown below - DO NOT modify them!**

⚠️ **WARNING: WHY are you editing this file?**

**✅ GOOD REASONS to edit:**
- Fixing actual code bugs (segfault, logic error, memory leak, etc.)
- Fixing incorrect test assertions or test bugs
- Adding missing functionality that's needed

**❌ BAD REASONS (treating build system symptoms!):**
- Changing BUILD.bazel to allow_empty=True → Install missing deps instead!
- Modifying CMakeLists.txt to skip checks → Fix the actual issue!
- Editing Makefile to remove failing targets → Understand why it fails!

**Rule:** If you're editing to "make the build pass", you're probably doing it WRONG.
Fix code bugs? Yes. Fix build config to bypass errors? No.

You need to provide code patch. The patch should according to the original code, indent correctly, and do not include line numbers. The format is as follows: 
### Thought: Modify explanation...
### Action: 
{DIFF_FENCE[0]} 
/absolute/path/of/target.py
{HEAD}
    exact copy of old line(s) you would like to change
{DIVIDER}
    new line(s) to replace
{UPDATED}

{HEAD}
    exact copy of old line(s) you would like to change
{DIVIDER}
    new line(s) to replace
{UPDATED}
{DIFF_FENCE[1]} 

⛔ **WRONG EXAMPLES (DO NOT USE):**
```diff
/repo/file.txt
<<<<<<< target_link_libraries  ← WRONG! Must be "<<<<<<< SEARCH"
<<<<<<< some_text  ← WRONG! Must be exactly "<<<<<<< SEARCH"
<<< SEARCH  ← WRONG! Must be "<<<<<<< SEARCH" (7 angle brackets + space)
```

✅ **CORRECT EXAMPLE:**
```diff
/repo/CMakeLists.txt
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    target_link_libraries(${{PROJECT_NAME}} gcc)
=======
    target_link_libraries(${{PROJECT_NAME}} gcc_s)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block must use this format:
1. The opening fence {DIFF_FENCE[0]} 
2. The file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
3. The start of search block: {HEAD}
4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
5. The dividing line: {DIVIDER}
6. The lines to replace into the source code
7. The end of the replace block: {UPDATED}
8. The closing fence: {DIFF_FENCE[1]} 
Once you want to modify the code you MUST: 
        * Include *ALL* the code being searched and replaced!
        * Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing source code, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
        * '{HEAD}', '{DIVIDER}' and  '{UPDATED}' symbols must be on a line by themselves and cannot be indented.
        * All code modifications must be expressed in the REPLACE format above (including delete an insert). We will find the source code with the highest matching degree in the original file and replace it. Please provide sufficient and unique old line(s) from snippet to facilitate matching.
        * If the code patch you provide is successfully applied, the differences before and after the code modification will be returned.
        * The paths of modified files must be completely absolute paths.
        * Make sure the patch you provide is indented correctly especially in python programs: The indentation of old lines is exactly the same as the original code, and the indentation of new lines is correct.
        * All patches must be based on the original code viewed by the tools, and fabricated code patch(es) is prohibited.
        * Previously successfully applied patches will modify the code, and new patches must be applied based on the current code. Please review the relevant code again then provide new patches.
        * If the old line(s) is empty, it is considered to be inserted at the beginning of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created and the new line will be written. like:
### Thought: Create a.py
### Action:
{DIFF_FENCE[0]}
/project_path/.../a.py
{HEAD}
{DIVIDER}
    [new line(s) to add]
{UPDATED}
{DIFF_FENCE[1]}
